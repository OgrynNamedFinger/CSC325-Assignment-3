HOW TO USE PROGRAM

run main.java
scanner will ask you for input numbers 1-3:
1 = ABSTRACT design/shapes that extend an abstract class
2 = INTERFACE design/shapes that implement multiple interfaces
3 = QUIT/end program

Why this comparison matters in real-world design:
Abstract classes and Interfaces can be used to create polymorphic relationships for objects, helping developers with managing many objects and subclasses as well as setting a foundation to work from. Abstract classes can act as a base to build off of while interfaces can act as a way to add modularity to subclasses, giving set methods and variables by implementation.
