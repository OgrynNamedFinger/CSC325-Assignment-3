## Benjamin Lukens AI reflection
What Ive used AI for: Imports. I gave chatgpt my App.java file asked to correct any missing
imports. As much as looking through documentation is beneficial, theres not enough time 
to search through each class. I use GPT for keycode imports as well.

I also used ChatGPT for separating the files by shape. Before I was creating shape.class files
for each shape.
