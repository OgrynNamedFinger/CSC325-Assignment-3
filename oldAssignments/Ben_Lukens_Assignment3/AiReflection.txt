-- AI USED: ChatGPT

I used chatGPT to generate the shapes and Shape.java by passing it the instructions as a prompt.
ChatGPT struggled heavily on this assignment, because it couldn't seem to figure out 
the file tree. I had to rework any code it wrote regarding packages and I had to move 
Shape.java into the shapes package because it wasnt reading otherwise. 
Rather than revising or critiquing the prompts, i just plugged the error messages into
a new prompt. When that stopped working I just fixed it myself by rewriting some of
the code and re-implementing the packages.
