So I do have to include this because I did have to use Copilot once during Level 1 as I was having issues with implementing some lines inside of Circle and Rectangle I believe it was... Yeah I didn't realize that I mispelt Abstract for the folder and so it was giving me an error for them because I mispelt Abstract as Abstact, so I was putting package Design.Abstract when I needed to put package Design.Abstract. Though I do have to admit that it is nice to know that I can use Copilot as a second pair of eyes. Also side tangent, I am about to start using a separate keyboard because I am getting tired of these sunkin keyboard keys, I've spelt Abstract as Abstact and Abstratc because of them! I did just buy a secondhand keyboard with raised keys not too long ago, mainly got it to use for Final Fantasy XIV Macros and typing in the in-game chat.
